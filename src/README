English is not my native language, i hope you understand it anyway. 

Automatic install in OMV:
------------------
install the autoshutdown-plugin from stable repository: http://packages.omv-plugins.org/


Automatic install in Debian/Ubuntu:
------------------
run "./install.sh" on the CLI

Manual Install:
---------------
Just copy:
autoshutdown.conf to /etc
autoshutdown.sh and libs.sh to /usr/local/bin

then setup the config-file and do a

    sudo chmod +x autoshutdown.sh

The script should run now. To start it @ boot, see http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/28

#########################################################################
Expert Settings in autoshutdown.conf:

LOADPROCNAMES
command names of processes with load dependent children to check if they have something to do
checked by default="proftpd,smbd,nfsd,transmission-daemon,mt-daapd,forked-daapd")
					 
TEMPPROCNAMES
command names of processes only started when active
checked with "top" AND "ps", so all processes are found, even such, which doesn't show up in top
like "lftp" - Beware: If the process shows up in "ps" when there is no connection, your PC won't shutdown!
maybe you have to call the process like this: "lftp -do -something -here && exit"
checked by default="in.tftpd")

if you want other processes than the default ones, please uncomment the above lines and add your process at the end of the line
to disable the process-check, set LOADPROCNAMES="-" or TEMPPROCNAMES="-"

The following scheme is mandatory for both LOADPROCNAMES and TEMPPROCNAMES:
process1,process2
all processes separated by comma ','

NETSTATWORD
It is needed, if someone wants to test autoshutdown.sh on the CLI, because on the CLI the netstat-output is language-specific. At systemstart netstat-output is always english
for german Debian/Ubuntu = "VERBUNDEN", other languages: 'netstat -n' on the CLI and you shoud see this output:

	# Aktive Internetverbindungen (ohne Server)
	# Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
	# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:2049     192.168.178.23:753      VERBUNDEN  
	# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:22       192.168.178.23:53099    VERBUNDEN

now take the word under "State" -> "VERBUNDEN" and set it for NETSTATWORD

SHUTDOWNCOMMAND
If you don't want to shutdown your PC, but go in hibernate/suspend: Define the command here
If nothing is defined, it shuts down with "shutdown -h now"

# SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="pm-hibernate" => puts the PC in hibernate-mode
# SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="pm-suspend"  => puts the PC in suspend-mode 
# SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="shutdown -h +5"  => shuts the PC down 5 min after shutdown-command
For more information and how to set up hibernate and suspend, look here:
http://wiki.debian.org/Suspend
http://wiki.debian.org/Hibernation

FAKE
set it to "true" for a Fake-Mode: The script runs dry: You can test what happens, without shutting down your PC
This is also possible through a switch in OMV-GUI. Setting it to "false" or if it is not set, the script will run normally.
With Fake-Mode ON, the script doesn't sleep 5 minutes after it starts.

PINGLIST
With this, you can define a path to a file, which contains list of IPs that should be scanned
only one IP per line is allowed - Format: mmm.nnn.ooo.ppp
e.g.:
192.168.1.45
If this expert-setting is used, the IPs specified in "RANGE" or in GUI doesn't work

AUTOUNRARCHECK
Only activate this feature, when using autounrar script
set it to "true" for a check, to "false" (or uncemmented) to skip the check
If an extraction-process of autounrar is running, the NAS is not shut down
AutoUnrar-Script: see https://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-unrar/
If you need a modified version of Autounrar, which runs on OMV, please leave me a message

UNRARLOGDIR
Set the log-Dir of status.info (from Autounrar)
replace <your_directoy> with target directory of autounrar logfile

UNRARLOG
Set the filename of "status.info" from autounrar

STATUSFILECHECK
Set this to true, if autoshutdown.sh should check for any *.status-File in $STATUSFILEDIR
set it to "false" (or uncemmented) to skip the check
if any file exists autoshutdown.sh doesn't shutdown the PC
Useful for backupscripts
It checks for a *.status file in a given Directory. If it exists, the PC is not shut down. It is not nice if the PC is shutting down while the backup-script is running. 
In my backup-script i use a simple

    touch anydir/backup.status

at the beginning and a

    rm anydir/backup.status

at the end of the script. In the boot-Phase also a

    rm anydir/*.status

to delete all *.status files, which are not deleted before (loss of power for example)

STATUSFILEDIR
location of the *.status-file created e.g. of a backup-script





### obsolete - not working anymore
SERVERIP and CLASS
only needed, if reading IP and CLASS from 'ifconfig eth0' fails or other NW-adapter is used
