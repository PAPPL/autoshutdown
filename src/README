Expert Settings in autoshutdown.conf:

NETSTATWORD
It is needed, if someone wants to test autoshutdown.sh on the CLI, because on the CLI the netstat-output is language-specific. At systemstart netstat-output is always english
for german Debian/Ubuntu = "VERBUNDEN", other languages: 'netstat -n' on the CLI and you shoud see this output:

	# Aktive Internetverbindungen (ohne Server)
	# Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
	# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:2049     192.168.178.23:753      VERBUNDEN  
	# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:22       192.168.178.23:53099    VERBUNDEN

now take the word under "State" -> "VERBUNDEN" and set it for NETSTATWORD

SERVERIP and CLASS
only needed, if reading IP and CLASS from 'ifconfig eth0' fails or other NW-adapter is used

AUTOUNRARCHECK      
Only activate this feature, when using autounrar script
set it to "true" for a check, to "false" (or uncemmented) to skip the check
If an extraction-process of autounrar is running, the NAS is not shut down
AutoUnrar-Script: see https://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-unrar/
If you need a modified version of Autounrar, which runs on OMV, please leave me a message

UNRARLOGDIR
Set the log-Dir of status.info (from Autounrar)
replace <your_directoy> with target directory of autounrar logfile

UNRARLOG
Set the filename of "status.info" from autounrar

STATUSFILECHECK
Set this to true, if autoshutdown.sh should check for any *.status-File in $STATUSFILEDIR
set it to "false" (or uncemmented) to skip the check
if any file exists autoshutdown.sh doesn't shutdown the PC
Useful for backupscripts
It checks for a *.status file in a given Directory. If it exists, the PC is not shut down. It is not nice if the PC is shutting down while the backup-script is running. 
In my backup-script i use a simple

    touch anydir/backup.status

at the beginning and a

    rm anydir/backup.status

at the end of the script. In the boot-Phase also a

    rm anydir/*.status

to delete all *.status files, which are not deleted before (loss of power for example)

STATUSFILEDIR
location of the *.status-file created e.g. of a backup-script
